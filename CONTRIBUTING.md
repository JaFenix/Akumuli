2. Create issue with description of your enchacement or bug report (if your pull-request contains bug-fix). Mention this
issue in your commit message if possible.
3. __(important)__ Make changes to **dev** branch, not **master**.

Things to start with:

There are a lot of examples in `Akumuli/libakumuli/query_processing`. TBD: tutorial.
2. New protocols. TBD: tutorial.
