**Akumuli** is a time-series storage, optimized specificaly for time searies data.
Main characteristics of time series data:
    * Higth write throughput;
    * Many time series data sources produce data with some frequence (for example - sensors);
    * Most of the writes are from current time with some delay;

First milestone goals
---------------------
    * Interpolation search
    * Compression
    * Configurable data redundancy
